Java
====

This repository has projects based on Java platform to try and test various concepts in Java. 
Main focus will remain concurrency and use of open source libraries.

Some projects may require external library dependencies e.g SwingNIOClientServer requires LMAX Disruptor 3.x and Java 7. 
From Java 7, it uses Async channel NIO APIs. 

Project names may not directly correlate with the actual functionality as SwingNIOxx is still console based.
