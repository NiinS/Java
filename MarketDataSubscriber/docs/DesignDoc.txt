      -- There can be multiple Gateways
  
      -- an event wheel is where raw events are pushed and which acts as a bridge between publishers and listeners
  
      -- e.g. A Disruptor based wheel will provide a lock-free access to wheel functionality
  
      -- other wheel impls can be possible e.g. a blocking queue based wheel realization will have the same 
         interface but a different internal impl.
         
      -- Event representation is protobuf based. Once built, a proto instance can't be built again, there we'd use
      Builder instances within a wheel and whenever an event slot has to be published or claimed, we'd build it partially
      to return a partial object.
